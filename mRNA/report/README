2. for i in `ls *final.out`;do mv $i ${i}.txt;done
3. prepare sample.txt according to file name
4. output/3_align/report bash align_sum.sh


报告信息统计

1. clean reads的质量（从fastp log,json 文件中提取）
Read1 after filtering total reads:
cat *log|grep -A 4 'after filtering'|grep 'total reads:'|sed 's/total reads: //g'

Read2 after filtering:
cat *log|grep -A 4 'aftering filtering'|grep 'total reads:'|sed 's/total reads: //g'

Read1 after filtering total bases
cat *log|grep -A 4 'after filtering'|grep 'total bases:'|sed 's/total bases: //g'

Read2 after filtering total bases
cat *log|grep -A 4 'aftering filtering'|grep 'total bases:'|sed 's/total bases: //g'

GC content(%)
cat *json | grep -w -A 9 'after_filtering' |grep 'gc_content' |sed 's/.*://g'

Q20 bases: 
cat *log|grep -A 4 'aftering filtering'|grep 'Q20 bases:'|sed 's/Q20 bases: //g'

Q30 bases:
cat *log|grep -A 4 'aftering filtering'|grep 'Q30 bases:'|sed 's/Q30 bases: //g'

2. 比对信息（从STAR比对结果final.out文件中提取，先统一添加txt后缀）
# Average mapped reads length
cat *txt |grep 'Average mapped length'|sed 's/Average mapped length |//g'

# Uniquely mapped reads number
cat *txt |grep 'Uniquely mapped reads number'|sed 's/Uniquely mapped reads number |//g'

# Uniquely mapped reads (%)
cat *txt |grep 'Uniquely mapped reads %'|sed 's/Uniquely mapped reads % |//g' |sed 's/%//g'

# Multiple mapped reads number
cat *txt |grep 'Number of reads mapped to multiple loci'|sed 's/Number of reads mapped to multiple loci |//g'


# Multiple mapped reads(%)
cat *txt |grep '% of reads mapped to multiple loci'|sed 's/% of reads mapped to multiple loci |//g'|sed 's/%//g'

# Number of  unmapped reads
cat *txt |grep 'Number of reads unmapped: too short'|sed 's/Number of reads unmapped: too short |//g'

cat *txt |grep '% of reads unmapped: too short'|sed 's/% of reads unmapped: too short |//g'| sed 's/%//g'

cat *txt |grep 'Number of reads unmapped: other'|sed 's/Number of reads unmapped: other |//g'

cat *txt |grep '% of reads unmapped: other'|sed 's/% of reads unmapped: other |//g'| sed 's/%//g'
